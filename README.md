## DMX Sendmail

This DMX Plugin can be used to send e-mails via SMTP or via [Sendgrid Web API v3](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/index.html). It's core feature is a service which allows other plugins to send emails to the `SYSTEM_ADMIN_MAILBOX` or to one or many other recipients with the sender being `SYSTEM_FROM_NAME` and `SYSTEM_FROM_MAILBOX`.

To configure the dmx-sendmail plugin you can set the following system properties, e.g. trough adding them to the `config.properties` file of your DMX installation (`dmx-platform/conf/config.properties`).
